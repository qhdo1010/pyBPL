pyBPL: Python-based Bayesian Program Learning
==============================================

pyBPL is a Python 3 package to implement Bayesian Program Learning (BPL)
using PyTorch backend. The BPL framework has been generalized to work with
various types of concepts. Character learning with Omniglot is one
manifestation of the BPL framework, and it is included here as the preliminary
use case (see Lake et al. 2015 "Human-level concept learning through
probabilistic program induction").
